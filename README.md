# codery-factor
For the codery-factor project I refactored an existing website to make it accessible. Through this project I gained experience using semantic elements, inserting comments, and making the code organized and efficient. To achieve this I started by adding alt attributes to all the img tags and fixed the search engine optimization link in the header. I cleaned up the code and inserted comments before each section or element. Finally, I added a header, section, figure, aside, and footer semantic elements.
